## Programming Language Project Assignment 1 - Getting Started &amp; Write-Up
To install the language, I all needed to do was download Xcode. There are other options, such as VS Code, but Xcode is the recommended programming environment, so it is the one Iâ€™m opting to use. To run programs, all you need to do is mouse over the line number of the last line of code in the chunk you want run. A play button will appear, and clicking it will run all the code in the program up to and including that line. To comment, simply start a line with two forward slashes and then write your comment.
